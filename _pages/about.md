I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at UT Austin, advised by [Dr. Kristen Grauman](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~grauman/). I am also a visiting researcher at [Facebook AI Research](https://ai.facebook.com/). My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision and reinforcement learning. My primary research has focused on learning intelligent behaviors for embodied agents in visually rich 3D and 360 environments. More broadly, I am also interested in leveraging self-supervision for learning useful representations, both in the context of image representations and higher-level representations of 3D spaces, and learning useful priors from human behavior for enhancing embodied agents.

Before joining UT Austin in 2017, I completed my integrated B.Tech and M.Tech in Electrical Engineering at IIT Madras. I was jointly advised by [Dr. Anurag Mittal](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~amittal/) and [Dr. Gaurav Sharma](http://www.grvsharma.com/research.html) for my M.Tech thesis.
