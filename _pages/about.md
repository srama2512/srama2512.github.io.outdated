I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at UT Austin, advised by [Dr. Kristen Grauman](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~grauman/). My primary research interests include 
Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning and their intersection. 

Before joining UT Austin in 2017, I completed my integrated B.Tech and M.Tech at IIT Madras. I was jointly advised by [Dr. Anurag Mittal](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~amittal/) and [Dr. Gaurav Sharma](http://www.grvsharma.com/research.html) for my M.Tech thesis.
